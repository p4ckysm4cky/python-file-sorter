# python-file-sorter


##Objective
Sorts files into folders, depending on their file extension. Note that it only copies files, and does not "move" / "delete" the previous files

##Potential issues:
* I have only tested this on Windows. Cannot confirm if it will work using Linux or Mac OSX
* The program currently is not able to copy folders individually, so if you have an extracted .zip file, it will cause all those files to be sorted by their extension
